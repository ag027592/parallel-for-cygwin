=head1 NAME

christmastree - use memory similar to a christmas tree profile

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<christmastree> [-s I<per_second>] [-m I<min>] <max>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GNU B<christmastree> is a test script that increases and decreases its
memory usage. The increase and descrease will happen at random, but
the memory usage will grow on average.

=over 9

=item I<max>

The maximal amount of memory to use before exitting.


=item B<-s> I<per_second>

The amount of memory it should grow per second on average. Default to max/10.


=item B<-m> I<min>

The minimal amount of memory to use before exitting.

=back
